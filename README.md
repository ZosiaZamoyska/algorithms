<details>
<summary>Minimum Distance</summary>
In Bajtocja, railway tracks run in a straight line from east to west. The houses of the residents are located to the north of the railway track.
If two people from different houses want to meet, they meet at the midpoint of the distance between their houses. However, this distance is not calculated in a traditional way as a straight-line segment between the houses.
Instead, the distance is determined as follows: a person first walks south to the railway tracks, then along the tracks to the line where the target house is located, and finally walks straight north to that house.
From all possible pairs of houses, we want to find the pair for which this distance is minimal.

### Dijkstra

<details>
<summary>Restricted paths</summary>
There is an undirected weighted connected graph. You are given a positive integer n which denotes that the graph has n nodes labeled from 1 to n, and an array edges where each edges[i] = [ui, vi, weighti] denotes that there is an edge between nodes ui and vi with weight equal to weighti.

A path from node start to node end is a sequence of nodes [z0, z1, z2, ..., zk] such that z0 = start and zk = end and there is an edge between zi and zi+1 where 0 <= i <= k-1.

The distance of a path is the sum of the weights on the edges of the path. Let distanceToLastNode(x) denote the shortest distance of a path between node n and node x. A restricted path is a path that also satisfies that distanceToLastNode(zi) > distanceToLastNode(zi+1) where 0 <= i <= k-1.

Return the number of restricted paths from node 1 to node n. Since that number may be too large, return it modulo 109 + 7.
