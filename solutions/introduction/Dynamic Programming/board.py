'''
A girl received a board with `n` fields, each containing an integer: p0, p1, ..., p(n-1).
A boy came up with a game:

Starting from position 0, you must move a token to position n-1 by rolling a six-sided die.
Each move lets you jump 1 to 6 fields forward.

The goal is to collect the highest possible total by summing the values of all visited fields,
starting from position 0 and ending at position n-1.

Return the maximum sum you can get by playing optimally.

Example:
Input:
5
3 1 -2 -1 3

Output:
7
(Explanation: 3 â†’ 1 â†’ 3 is the optimal path, skipping negative values)
