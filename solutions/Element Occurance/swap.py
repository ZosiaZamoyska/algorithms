    We are given an integer m (1 < m â‰¤ 1,000,000) and two arrays, A and B, 
    each containing n integers: 
    A = [a0, a1, ..., an-1] and B = [b0, b1, ..., bn-1], 
    where 0 < ai, bi < m.

    We need to determine whether there exists a swap operation that can be 
    performed on these arrays such that, after the swap, the sum of elements 
    in array A is equal to the sum of elements in array B.

    A "swap operation" means selecting one element from array A and one element 
    from array B and exchanging their values.
